**to create a new project
composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app


**to make a controller class:
php artisan make:controller <controllerName>

**to make a model class:
php artisan make:model <modelName>


** By default, Laravel contains a folder called migrations : example-app\database\migrations
This folder contains definitions for database tables. The default tables are related to user and authentication.
To run migration : php artisan migrate

Note, migration uses the Schema class query builder. The default string column length is > 1000 bytes, which causes SQL errors for index columns.

To set a default length for mysl varchar :
got to -> example-app\app\Providers\AppServiceProvider.php
set-> public function boot(): void
    {
        Schema::defaultStringLength(191);
    }



**Encryption:

LAravel encryption users the .env APP_KEY as an encryption key. This key can be set by running php artisan key:generate


**Scheduling:
Check Laravel documentation to see how to define and schedule tasks within the API.

To be able to run scheduled Laravel jobs, a cron file must be created, this can be done by going to
cpanel->Advanced->cron jobs-> add cron job
    Set the cron job to run every minute (as recommended by Laravel, since Laravel scheduler will be run and will take over scheduled jobs.)

    paste the following command:
    cd /home/codefolio/public_html/testAPI/ && php artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1

    note: >> /dev/null 2>&1 will tell the cron job scheduler to output the results to nowhere, instead of sending them by email.

**To deploy Project on Cpanel

Create a new directory named public_html/...subfolders.../API on your host.

In my case, I always deploy that folder inside the web application folder;
for example, public_html/ctservWebsite/API

Paste the laravel project content in this folder=> after pasting, API should contain app, bootstrap,config .. etc folders.

Inside the API folder is a public directory.
Copy the content of that public directory into the public_html/...subfolders.../API directory.

Edit the public_html/API directory/index.php file like this:

Change require
__ DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';
to require
__ DIR__.'/vendor/autoload.php';
Change
require_once __ DIR__.'/../bootstrap/app.php';
to
require_once __ DIR__.'/bootstrap/app.php';


call any API route: https://ctserv.net/testSuppApp/API/api/basic --here basic is one of the defined routes
